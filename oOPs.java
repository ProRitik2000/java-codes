//‚úÖ‚úÖOOPs :- Object Oriented Programming System/Structure
//'SmallTalk' is the 1st purely object oriented programming language.
//It is a programming paradigm or methodology through which we do developments
//Here,paradigm can also be termed as a method to solve problem or do some task or also we can say
//that it is a method to solve problems using tools & techniques that're available to us following
//some approach.

//Programming paradigm are of following types:-
//1Ô∏è‚É£Procedural2Ô∏è‚É£ Functional 3Ô∏è‚É£Logical 4Ô∏è‚É£Structural5Ô∏è‚É£ Object-Oriented

//5Ô∏è‚É£Object-Oriented Programming----->
//Six main pillars of OOPs are as follows-
//1Ô∏è‚É£Class
//Real world examples of class:Animals,Birds,Vehicles,furnitures,fruits
//has methods like : Animal class has some methods like eat(),run(),fly(),
//collection of objects
//a template or a blueprint
//isn't a real world entity
//doesn't occupy memory (because it isn't a real world entity)

//NOTE:-üëÅ‚Äçüó®üëÅ‚Äçüó®first letter of class name must be UPPERCASE
//SYNTAX:Access-modifier class className
//{

//}

// 2Ô∏è‚É£Object & Methods 
//Real world examples of Object:Dog,cat(Animal),Sparrow,Peacock(Birds),Car,Jeap(Vehicles)
//
//3Ô∏è‚É£Inheritance
//4Ô∏è‚É£Abstraction5Ô∏è‚É£polymorphism6Ô∏è‚É£Encapsulation

//public: Accessible everywhere.
// private: Accessible only within the class.
// protected: Accessible within the class, package, and subclasses.
// default: Accessible within the package.
// Access specifiers ke use se hum apne code ko secure aur well-encapsulated bana sakte hain, 
//taaki unnecessary ya unauthorized access ko roka ja sake.
